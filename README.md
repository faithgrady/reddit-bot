# Reddit Keyword Monitor Bot

A lightweight Python tool that uses the Reddit Data API (via PRAW) to monitor new Reddit comments for a small set of predefined keywords. When a keyword is detected, the bot sends an internal notification (ex: Discord via webhook) so moderators or support staff can quickly review the linked Reddit content.

This bot is read-only. It never votes, posts, messages users, or takes any moderation actions. It simply helps moderators monitor conversations and respond appropriately.
